# LearningVectorQuantization

This is a simple Python code for those who are interested in implementing the Learning Vector Quantization. 
Assume that you have some random data sets with corresponding labels, such as T="0", "1" etc. You want to classify these 
data sets with LVQ.

You can use the defined function "LVQ" and try different numbers as its arguments.
To increase the performance you can use more accurate data set instead of random ones and you can also implement LVQ 2, LVQ 2.1, and LVQ 3.
